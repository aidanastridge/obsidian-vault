Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [nested rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules#nesting), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules), and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

- If you’re looking for an introduction to Sass, check out [the tutorial](https://sass-lang.com/guide).
    
- If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than [the built-in module reference](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules).
    
- If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the [JS API documentation](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#usage).
    
- Or the [Dart API documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/sass/latest/sass/sass-library.html) if you’re calling it from Dart.
    
- Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference!
    
## Older Versions

This documentation is written for the most recent version of the Sass language. If you’re using [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) 1.84.0, you’ll have access to all the features described here. But if you’re using an older version of Dart Sass or a deprecated Sass implementation like [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) or [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass), there may be some behavioral differences.
