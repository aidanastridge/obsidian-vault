*Insinuate*

"Insinuate" means to suggest something indirectly or subtly, often with the intention of implying something negative or unpleasant. Think of it like whispering a secret, but instead of a secret, it's a hint of something not quite right.

**"She insinuated that he was lazy by saying, 'Well, someone certainly isn't in a hurry to get this project done.'**
