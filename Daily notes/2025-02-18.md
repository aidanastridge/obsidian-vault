"This is just me practicing recording. This is effectively a Python script that takes audio, transcribes it with openAI and whisper AI, and then gets at the JSON and puts that into a markdown document that goes straight to my Obsidian Vault. And ultimately that's 80 seconds of recording. I think that's good enough of time. It seems like I might need less, actually. But this is just the start, right? Okay."
