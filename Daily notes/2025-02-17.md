Hello, this is my first recording on a note that I'm making. So effectively today I finished up a recording, a script, Python script that basically I can record audio, and transcribe it with whisper AI, and then I can basically convert that to JSON and then JSON on and then convert that to Markdown. So I can go right to my Obsidian Vault. Effectively, what else I did today was I did a puzzle, some of the puzzle, and also I've kind of started working on auto-compiling CSS, SASS, you know, the synthatic form. So doing that right now. So that's for theme design and having some other ideas. I'm trying to get AI attached to my Obsidian Vault too, and hopefully I'll be able to get that done probably even tonight, but probably tomorrow, I'd say. And effectively that's what I've been kind of working on. And I recorded quite a bit and maybe I don't need a minute and a half, maybe a minute's enough. Clearly it showed that half a minute wasn't good enough.
