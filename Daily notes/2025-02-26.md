 Okay, so specifically I'm recording this for 60 seconds. What I've been working on recently is working on the theme Nutmeg it's taking a lot of time but I keep going back and forth on it and I think I have a lot more stronger grasp on the CSS background of obsidian, so that's what I'm really working on now, and I'm also learning SCSS in the process Really is a godsend. Other than that I'm trying to make some templates for my Obsidian vault, but ultimately that's really what I'm kind of working on right now. So I will wait till the end of the Plug-in or script I Don't know why before I was having problems with recording user input It's like you had to record all the time which was weird.
